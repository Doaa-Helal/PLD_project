### üîç Custom Programming Language Parser 

This project implements a **custom parser and interpreter** for a simplified high-level programming language, designed to support core programming constructs such as:

-   Variable assignments (including arrays)
-   Arithmetic expressions
-   Conditional statements (`if`, `else`)
-   Looping constructs (`for`, `do-while`, `switch`)
-   Expression parsing and evaluation

The language uses a custom grammar defined in BNF (Backus--Naur Form) and supports standard features found in imperative languages.
